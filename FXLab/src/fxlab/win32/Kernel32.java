     * To allocate memory in the address space of another process, use the VirtualAllocEx function.
     * 
     * @param lpAddress
     *          The starting address of the region to allocate. If the memory is being reserved, the specified address is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the allocation granularity. 
     *          If the memory is already reserved and is being committed, the address is rounded down to the next page boundary. To determine the size of a page and the allocation granularity 
     *          on the host computer, use the GetSystemInfo function. If this parameter is NULL, the system determines where to allocate the region.
     * 
     *          If this address is within an enclave that you have not initialized by calling InitializeEnclave, VirtualAlloc allocates a page of zeros for the enclave at that address. 
     *          The page must be previously uncommitted, and will not be measured with the EEXTEND instruction of the Intel Software Guard Extensions programming model.

     *          the allocated pages include all pages containing one or more bytes in the range from lpAddress to lpAddress+dwSize. 
     *          This means that a 2-byte range straddling a page boundary causes both pages to be included in the allocated region.
