     * Retrieves a handle to a window whose class name and window name match the specified strings.

     *          A handle to the parent window whose child windows are to be searched.

     *          The function searches among windows that are child windows of the desktop.
     *          If hwndParent is HWND_MESSAGE, the function searches all message-only windows.
     * 
     * @param child
     *          A handle to a child window. The search begins with the next child window in the Z order. 
     *          The child window must be a direct child window of hwndParent, not just a descendant window.
     *          If hwndChildAfter is NULL, the search begins with the first child window of hwndParent.
     *          Note that if both hwndParent and hwndChildAfter are NULL, the function searches all top-level and message-only windows.
     * 
     * @param className
     *          The class name or a class atom created by a previous call to the RegisterClass or RegisterClassEx function.

     *          If lpszClass is a string, it specifies the window class name. 
     *          The class name can be any name registered with RegisterClass or RegisterClassEx, or any of the predefined control-class names, or it can be MAKEINTATOM(0x8000). 
     *          In this latter case, 0x8000 is the atom for a menu class. For more information, see the Remarks section of this topic.
     *

     *          The window name (the window's title). If this parameter is NULL, all window names match.

     *      If the function succeeds, the return value is a handle to the window that has the specified class and window names.
